# Introduction
For at least three decades, scientists have advocated the return of geological samples from Mars. One early
concept was the Sample Collection for Investigation of Mars (SCIM) proposal, which involved sending a
spacecraft in a grazing pass through Mars's upper atmosphere to collect dust and air samples without
landing or orbiting.
As of late 1999, the MSR mission was anticipated to be launched from Earth in 2003 and 2005. Each was to
deliver a rover and a Mars ascent vehicle, and a French supplied Mars orbiter with Earth return capability
was to be included in 2005. Sample containers orbited by both MAVs were to reach Earth in 2008. This
mission concept, considered by NASA's Mars Exploration Program to return samples by 2008, was cancelled
following a program review
